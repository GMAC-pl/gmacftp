# Privacy Checklist

This repository is intended to be public. Keep personal data and production credentials out of git.

## Never Commit

- `data/` exports from a third-party file manager, FileZilla, or any other FTP client
- Passwords, API tokens, SSH private keys, or `.env` files
- `.env.personal` or any other local private build identity file
- macOS Keychain exports
- App vault files from the user config directory
- Screenshots showing a real home directory, customer host, private domain, or private filename
- Local build products from `target/`
- Local tool state such as editor settings and `.DS_Store`

## Build Variants

`scripts/build-app.sh` can build both a personal bundle and a public bundle.

- The public bundle uses safe defaults from the tracked source tree.
- The personal bundle reads `.env.personal`, which is ignored by git and must stay local.
- Never copy values from `.env.personal` into tracked docs, scripts, screenshots, or CI.

## Safe Demo Data

Use:

- `example.com` or localhost hosts
- `testuser` / `testpass` for local servers
- `/Users/demo/...` or `~/Downloads` for paths
- Small synthetic files in `/tmp`

## Pre-Publish Scan

Run this before making the repository public:

```sh
git status --short
git ls-files
rg -n "password|secret|token|apikey|api_key|/Users/<local-user>|data/connections" . \
  --glob '!target/**' \
  --glob '!.git/**'
```

Review any matches manually. Some words may be legitimate documentation, but no real private value should remain.

## Screenshot Policy

Only screenshots under `docs/screenshots/` are intended for public documentation. They must use sample data and must not be taken from a real personal filesystem view.
